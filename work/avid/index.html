              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">About the Project</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">Avid is an industry-leading technology and multimedia company. They are widely known for their popular audio and video editing software solutions which are used in recording, television, and movie studios around the world. I began working with Avid in July of 2022, and shortly after, we began the process of redesigning and rebuilding Avid's website. I was a core contributor to this massive project, which involved merging marketing and e-commerce sites into one cohesive experience. This project also required a new visual direction which resulted in new components, templates, a vastly expanded design system, and a new checkout experience.</p>

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">My Contribution</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">I provided interface design, UX design, and technical writing on this project, collaborating with key stakeholders throughout the company to cover a complex array of product offerings and options. I was a core contributor to the redesign and development of new components and templates. I was the lead designer for Avid's Figma design system, which expanded greatly during this process with numerous new components and templates, including a numerous amount of variants and edge cases. I also provided technical writing for Avid's internal web-facing design system, providing clear usage guidelines for content creators, designers, and developers. I served as the lead interface designer for an entirely new e-commerce checkout experience. Additionally, I provided technical writing to guide the web development teams, ensuring that interaction, accessibility, and responsive layouts were built according to specifications.</p>

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Challenges</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">User feedback and internal testing had shown that visual inconsistency was a huge issue with the old website. Having separate websites for marketing and e-commerce led to a disjointed experience for customers. As the old website had no system of components and templates, there was very little consistency from page to page, causing a confusing experience for both our customers and our internal content creators, designers, and developers. Additionally, the old website was often poorly supported on responsive screen sizes, had poor accessibility, and did not follow UI/UX best practices. Customer feedback also gave poor marks to the checkout process, which was in dire need of redesign.</p>

            <div class="work-item-text-content">
              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Build Out the Design System</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">Avid had already begun the process of setting up a design system when I arrived, having a core set of colors, typography, and a few basic components, but it was far from mature. I worked with a small team of designers to build out a vastly expanded batch of new components and templates, serving a wide range of products and customer needs. After this initial design process, I took lead design responsibilities to cover all component/template variants, edge cases, and responsive breakpoints. I ensured that all newly designed elements were properly integrated into our Figma design system library, as well as our internal design system website. This led to a robust family of components and templates that would improve visual consistency, enhance Avid's brand, and lead to much easier creation of new content for internal teams.</p>

            <div class="work-item-text-content">
              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Systems to Guide Internal Teams</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">Avid's old website suffered from a lack of systems-based thinking. As mentioned above, there was no system of consistent components or templates, and internal teams struggled to create new web content without clear direction to guide new web development or page creation. I provided a large amount of technical writing to this project to help bridge the gap between design and development teams. I provided detailed guidelines for functional requirements, guiding the web development teams to ensure that components and templates were built accurately. These guidelines covered design requirements at all responsive breakpoints and interaction states, and covered accessibility affordances,variants, and edge cases. I also provided QA testing to ensure that design and development efforts were properly synced.</p>

              <p class="work-item-text">Another place where Avid could benefit from improved systems was better internal guidance around how to create new content. With a newly expanded design system of components and templates, I provided technical writing to create usage guidelines for how to use new design system elements, providing best practice guidance and variant examples to guide Avid's designers, developers, and content creators.</p>

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Improve Checkout</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">As Avid previously had separate web experiences for their marketing and e-commerce efforts, this led to a confusing and disjointed checkout experience. I served as lead interface designer on this replatforming project, helping to create a consistent and intuitive checkout experience that properly served Avid's brand. I worked with key stakeholders on establishing a clear user purchase flow, covering all edge cases and purchase paths. This involved creating new design system components, templates, and various design affordances to cover the wide range of Avid's product offerings.</p>

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Outcome</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">The results of this project led to numerous positive outcomes for Avid. A greatly expanded design system provided new components and templates to cover a wide range of content needs, while enhancing Avid's brand with drastically improved visual consistency. Providing better internal systems and usage guidelines led to more efficient web development of new components, and provided clear guidelines for internal design, content, and development teams moving forward. A much improved checkout experience led to a more consistent and intuitive experience for Avid's customers, resolving previous pain points.</p>
