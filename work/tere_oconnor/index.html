              <p class="work-item-text">
                I provided all design and development duties for this project, which included content strategy, interface design, web development, and a custom Wordpress theme. I also made adjustments to the Wordpress admin panel to make site updates easier for the company.

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Problems with the Old Website</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">
                The company's previous website was build in outdated Flash technology, which was beginning to look quite outdated and did not function well on mobile devices. Additionally, the site was very difficult to maintain, usually requiring the assistance of a web developer to make basic site updates.

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">A More Modern Approach</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">
                I worked with Tere to establish content goals for the new site, which would be centered around company news, teaching resources, performance details, and media. Having worked with Tere on other design projects in the past, I already had a sense for his design preferences, and created something more modern that showcased the beautiful photography from his company's performances. I built a fully responsive site with a custom Wordpress theme. Additionally, I made upgrades to the Wordpress admin area to make site updates easy and intuitive for the company to update on their own.

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Outcome</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">
                The new website was a huge improvement for the company, allowing them to easily make site updates through Wordpress. Readability was much improved, and the website now featured an expanded media section and up to date performance details. The responsive site now worked on all modern devices, with a design aesthetic that more closely matched the brand of the company.
