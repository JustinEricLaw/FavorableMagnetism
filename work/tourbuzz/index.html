            <p class="work-item-text">
              Tourbuzz (a subsidiary of Urbanimmersive) provides software solutions to help real estate photographers increase efficiency and productivity while managing their businesses. The Client Panel provides an easy way for photographers to deliver media assets to agents. This feature also allows agents to adjust settings and property info for "single property websites", which are customizable website templates used to highlight listings.

            <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">My Contribution</h2>
            <p class="work-item-text">
              As the sole designer involved in this project, I provided lead UX and interface design. I worked with our customer support team to gather feedback and insights from customers regarding various pain points. My process included research analysis, wireframing, interface design, and CSS.

            <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Pain Points with the Client Panel</h2>
            <p class="work-item-text">
              User feedback of the Client Panel had consistently shown frustration with confusing navigation, visual inconsistency, and poor support on mobile devices. Additionally, the Client Panel had accumulated a notable amount of technical debt, causing browser issues. Overhauling this project could make a significant difference to customers by increasing efficiency and drastically reducing the amount of support hours spent resolving issues.

            <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Improve Navigation</h2>
            <p class="work-item-text">
              The Client Panel had accumulated many features over the years, leading to a confusing system of menu components. The new layout improved usability by presenting an agent's list of tours/properties as the panel's homepage. After selecting a property, a single navigation component would become visible, listing all actions for a given property. The header was also simplified to contain branding, support, and account settings.

            <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Make it Responsive</h2>
            <p class="work-item-text">
              The previous version of the Client Panel was not responsive, so many tasks were basically impossible to complete on mobile devices. This was the most asked for feature for the new panel, so I focused on a mobile-first approach to help simplify the design and ensure ease of use on small screens. Improving navigation and removing clutter from the header went hand in hand with an easier to use layout on smaller screens.

            <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Visual Consistency</h2>
            <p class="work-item-text">
              The previous version of the Client Panel suffered from a great deal of visual inconsistency, which included irregularity with colors, font-sizing, hierarchy, and interface components. The engineering team had begun using React along with a component library called Semantic UI in other parts of Tourbuzz. I was asked to conduct an audit of current component libraries to determine if we should pivot to another library. Creating a custom design system was not possible due to the limits of our small team and the fast turnaround required. I did a quick audit of current options, but ultimately landed on sticking with Semantic UI due to its ease of React integration, customization, and wide array of components. I customized Semantic's typography, hierarchy, and colors so that our engineering team could build new features with efficiency and consistency.

            <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Outcome</h2>
            <p class="work-item-text">
              The redesign of the Client Panel was largely a success. After ironing out bugs and iterating on user feedback in the beta testing period, customers reported an overwhelmingly positive view of the new panel. Updates to navigation and visual consistency were clear improvements, and making the panel responsive meant that users could now reliably be productive on any modern device.
            </p>

            <p class="work-item-text">
              Working with a tight time frame, I learned how valuable it can be to collaborate cross-functionally with teams across a company. With customer support, design, and engineering teams working together throughout the process, we were able to be highly efficient in reaching a fast turnaround for our users. Regular communication between teams helped us to resolve many issues before they occurred, and conversations with users led to more meaningful dialogue and results.
