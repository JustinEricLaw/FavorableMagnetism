              <p class="work-item-text">
                Georgia Tech's College of Computing, based in Atlanta, is consistently ranked among the top 10 computing programs in the nation. The college includes four schools and multiple research centers, attracting students and faculty from all around the world.

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">My Contribution</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">
                I worked with Georgia Tech's College of Computing for over four years. During this time I took on many responsibilities including visual design, art direction, and interface design. I led visual rebranding efforts for all communications materials, and created a design system for use within the College's schools and research centers. I led interface design efforts for redesigning the college's suite of websites, and assisted the team with information architecture and front-end development. I also managed multiple student employees and took on project management duties for various communications projects.

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Challenges Faced</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">
                When I began working with Georgia Tech Computing in 2011, their communications and marketing materials were notably inconsistent from a visual standpoint. It was clear that the College, as well its affiliated schools and research centers, needed to present a much more consistent brand to audiences. The college's websites were also in great need of a redesign. Additionally, as the only designer serving the College of Computing, it was impossible for me to support all of the projects needed by our schools and research centers. I would need to implement systems to help smaller projects be completed by other staff members with little to no design training.

              <h2 class="work-item-section-heading">Consistent Messaging and Branding</h2>
              <p class="work-item-text">
                The College of Computing regularly generated print and digital communications materials, primarily reaching out to four main groups: students, faculty, alumni, and donors. These materials had inconsistent visual style, messaging, and branding. I collaborated with the college's Director of Communications to establish distinct messaging and a uniform visual presentation. I worked within Georgia Tech's institute level style guidelines while providing the college with its own unique visual identity. Through meetings with stakeholders and leaders across the college, we established that our people were our strength. To help represent this, I provided project management and art direction for numerous photo and video shoots of our faculty and students, generating assets for use in future communications projects. I setup reusable typographical systems and an accessible visual style to be used across all communication mediums.
